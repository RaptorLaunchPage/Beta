## Technical Implementation

### **Enhanced Form Features**
```tsx
// Smart match selection based on slot's match_count
const matches = Array.from({ length: slot.match_count }, (_, i) => i + 1)

// Duplicate prevention with existing performance check  
const existingMatch = existingPerformances.find(p => p.match_number === match_number)

// Visual status indicators
<Badge className="bg-green-100 text-green-800">
  Match 1: ✓ 8K 2156D
</Badge>
```

### **Tab Consolidation Logic**
```tsx
// Unified permission checking
const canSubmitPerformance = userRole === 'player'
const canStaffSubmit = ['admin', 'manager', 'coach'].includes(userRole)  
const canViewAttendance = ['admin', 'manager', 'coach', 'player'].includes(userRole)

// Single submission tab for all roles
{(canSubmitPerformance || canStaffSubmit) && (
  <TabsContent value="submit">
    <EnhancedPlayerPerformanceSubmit onPerformanceAdded={fetchPerformances} />
  </TabsContent>
)}
```

### **Attendance Integration**
```tsx
// Dedicated attendance tab with proper layout
<TabsContent value="attendance">
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Match Attendance Log</CardTitle>
      <CardDescription>
        View automatically generated attendance records from match performances
      </CardDescription>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>

    </CardContent>
  </Card>
