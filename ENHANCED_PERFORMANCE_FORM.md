## Integration

### Replace Existing Form
```tsx
// Old

// New  
import { EnhancedPlayerPerformanceSubmit } from "./enhanced-player-performance-submit"

// Usage
<EnhancedPlayerPerformanceSubmit onPerformanceAdded={refreshData} />
```

### Required Dependencies
- All existing UI components (Card, Button, Input, Label, Select, Badge)
- Additional icons: `CheckCircle`, `Clock` from lucide-react
- Existing hooks and utilities (useAuth, supabase, useToast)

## Data Flow

### Slot Selection
1. Player selects slot
2. Fetch slot details: `SELECT id, organizer, time_range, date, match_count, team_id FROM slots WHERE id = ?`
3. Generate match numbers: `[1, 2, 3, ..., match_count]`

### Existing Performance Check
1. Fetch existing performances: `SELECT match_number, kills, damage, placement, id FROM performances WHERE slot = ? AND player_id = ?`
2. Mark completed matches as disabled
3. Show stats for completed matches

### Validation
1. Check if selected match already exists
2. Validate match number is within slot's match_count
3. Standard field validation
4. Prevent submission if duplicate
